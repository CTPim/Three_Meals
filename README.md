# Three Meals - An Analysis of Food Prices Vs. Stock Market Behavior

## Overview:

As a team, we set our sights on trying to analyze whether there is a correlation between the prices of everyday food items and the behaviour of the USA's largest stock market index, the Dow Jones (DJIA), then try to predict if the DJIA will see an increase or decrease through the use of a machine learning predictive model.  The thought process being: a rise in food prices is typical of an inflationary period in the US economy, and inflation usually coincides with investors being less willing to invest in the markets as there is higher risk.

Our team took a high and low level approach when choosing what datasets to include within the analysis on the food market end.  We found it helpful to start by looking at and collecting datasets of the average prices of bread, milk, and beef as they are typically staples of the average american diet.  From there, we decided to view the food market from a wider lense, and looked at the consumer price index (CPI) for food of all urban US consumers. The individual prices we took are some of the pieces used to calculate the food CPI, the food CPI is a part of the overall CPI for all US goods, and the CPI for all US goods is a dataset usually used as indicator/predictor of inflation. 

On the financial side, our team used the DJIA dataset as our test variable.  We used Dow Jones data starting from 1990 to present day to serve as a block to base our correlations upon.  It is also the data that we used to try predict if the DJIA will see an increase or decrease through the use of our machine learning model.

## Questions we are trying to answer:
- Is there a correlation between food prices/food CPI and large scale stock market index behavior?
- Can a prediction of market behavior be made based on the past trends of food prices?
- Do different goods have a larger impact on certain markets?

## Raw Datasets & Applications:
### (Here is the dataset that was found, here is why it is revelant...)

- Average milk price (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000709112)
    - Data showing the average prices of milk from July 1995 to January 2023.  Price of milk per gallon (lb) is a variable used in calculating the food CPI.  CPI's are good indicators of inflation.

- Average beef price (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000703112)
    - Data showing the monthly average price of beef from 1990 to 2023. Price is listed in dollars per pound. As a food staple, the price of beef may have an impact on finances for business and individuals.  

- Average Bread (Wheat) price (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000702212)
    - Data showing the average prices of bread from mid 1960's to present day.  Price of bread per pound (lb) is a variable used in calculating the food CPI.  CPI's are good indicators of inflation.

- CPI - food (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SAF112)
    - CPI's are the overall change in consumer prices based on a representative basket of goods and services over time.  For the project analysis, the Food CPI will be reviewed.  The data provides index values (based in 1982-84=100) from the mid 1960's to present day. CPI's are good indicators of inflation.

- Dow Jones DJIA (https://www.investing.com/indices/us-30-historical-data)
    - The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a stock market index that tracks 30 large publicly owned US companies. It is often used as an indicator of the overall health of the US economy and stock market. 

- NASDAQ API (https://blog.data.nasdaq.com/api-for-commodity-data)
    - The Nasdaq Data Link API displays commodity data. We will be using it for grain prices and farm data.

- USDA.gov API (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html)
    - THe USDA FoodData Central API has a Food Seach function which allows us to view information about different foods.

- CME Datamine API (https://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/datamine-api.html)
    - Data from the CME regarding different commodities on the market and their historical prices.

- The Consumer Price Index(https://api.dol.gov/V1/Statistics/CPI) The Consumer Price Index measures US consumer spending on Food.

## Analysis/Results
Our team used Pandas, NumPy, and MatPlotLib as the primary libraries to carry out our analysis and ETL of the raw datasets.  To standardize the data so that it can be effectively cleaned, merged, and analyzed we agreed to only look at data from 1990 to present day, and rename columns to common names and add unit values ("DATE" to "date_time", USD/LB, etc...), and make sure that all data types were changed from object to float/int/etc...  Once the data was cleaned, it would be uploaded to our PostGres database, and visualizations were created.  Some of our latest visualizations are shown below.

- Machine Learning Model: Classification Report:
    ![ML1_ClassificationReport.png](https://github.com/CTPim/Three_Meals/blob/main/Images/ML1_ClassificationReport.png)
    
    - According to our classification report, the logistic regression model seems to be more accurate at predicting a positive change in the Dow Jones; the precision is -0.69 and the recall/sensitivity is 0.88. The model is much less accurate at predicting a negative change, with the precision being 0.36 and the recall/sensitivity  being 0.15. The F1 Scores are .78 and .22, respectively.

- CPI of All Items Vs CPI of Food: 
    !["CPI All Items vs. Food.png"](https://github.com/CTPim/Three_Meals/blob/CPi-Comparison-Code-%26-Charts/Images/CPI%20-%20All%20Items%20vs.%20Food.png)
    
    !["CPI - All Items & Food Correlation.png"](https://github.com/CTPim/Three_Meals/blob/CPi-Comparison-Code-%26-Charts/Images/CPI%20-%20All%20Items%20%26%20Food%20Correlation.png)
    
    - The CPI for food is a portion of the data used to calculate the CPI for all goods.  This graph compares the CPI of food against the CPI of all goods from 1990 to present day to try to show a correlation.  As the CPI for food is part of the calculation for the CPI of all goods, a correlation is expected (as shown on the graph).  the correlation is further proven using Pandas .corr() function to get a value of .985.

- CPI Percentage Change per Year Graph and Correlation: 
    !["CPI All Items vs. Food.png"](https://github.com/CTPim/Three_Meals/blob/main/Images/CPI%20-%20All%20Items%20vs.%20Food.png)
    
    !["CPI - PCT Change Correlation.png"]([https://github.com/CTPim/Three_Meals/blob/CPi-Comparison-Code-%26-Charts/Images/CPI%20-%20All%20Items%20vs.%20Food%20pct%20change.png](https://github.com/CTPim/Three_Meals/blob/CPi-Comparison-Code-%26-Charts/Images/CPI%20-%20PCT%20Change%20Correlation.png))
    
    - The percent change of the CPI index over the course of a year is used to be an indicator of inflation.  This graph shows the yearly percent change from 1990 to present day of the food CPI and the CPI of all goods to try to show a correlation.  Based on this visualization and the 0.45 correlation value, there is little correlation between annual percentage change of the food CPI and the CPI of all goods.

    
## Process:
    1. Find raw dataset
    2. Upload to raw data folder on git
    3. Use Pandas for ETL on raw data, and then save to edited data folder.
    4. Make ERD for SQL/Postgres table create (primary keys, etcâ€¦) 
    5. Make postgres database and add edited dataset to postgres to create tables

## General Data Procedure/Notes
- Analyze data monthly from 1990 to present day
- Import dataset to pandas to create dataframe
- Change names of columns (date column to be: "date_time", price column to be: "Price (unit of measure)", Index, etc...)
- Create a new column called for "Percent Change" and determine the change in price percentage of the targeted food by using Pandas function pct_change()
- Confirm that all data types are changed to datetime/float/int/etc...  (eliminate strings that are not necessary)
- Create ERD diagram identifying primary and foreign keys (https://dbdiagram.io/d)
- When dataframe is cleaned and ERD is created, send message to team for integration into postgres database.
