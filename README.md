# Three Meals - 

## Overview:
- General idea: Find a relation between food prices and large scale stock index prices
    - Foods being analyzed:
        - Wheat/Bread
        - Beef
        - Milk
        - Food CPI
    
    - Indices/Financial being analyzed:
        - DOW JONES (DJIA)
        - NASDAQ?
        - USDA
        - CME

## Raw Datasets & Applications:

    - XXXXXXX

- Average beef price (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000703112)
    - XXXXXXX

- Average milk price (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000702212)

## Process:
    1. Find raw dataset
    2. Upload to raw data folder on git
    3. Use Pandas for ETL on raw data, and then save to edited data folder.
    4. Make ERD for SQL/Postgres table create (primary keys, etcâ€¦) 
    5. Make postgres database and add edited dataset to postgres to create tables

## General Data Procedure/Notes
- Analyze data monthly from 1990 to present day
- Import dataset to pandas to create dataframe
- Confirm that all data types are changed to datetime/float/int/etc...  (eliminate strings that are not necessary)
- Create ERD diagram identifying primary and poreign keys (https://dbdiagram.io/d)
- When dataframe is cleaned and ERD is created, send message to team for integration into postgres database.

## Roles:
- Git Manager: Chumpon
- Postgres Manager: Maxine
- ETL/Analysts: By team members for their respective datasets
- Predictive Model Manager: TBD
